# requirements.txt
# Core dependencies for the detection project and fine-tuning workflows
# NOTE: PyTorch (torch) has multiple builds depending on CUDA/ROCm/CPU. Choose the
# correct installation line from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally and then
# run the matching pip/conda command. Installing a generic `pip install torch` may
# pull a CPU-only wheel which is fine if you don't need GPU acceleration.

# How to install (example, CPU-only):
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you need CUDA-enabled PyTorch, install torch first with the correct CUDA
# selector then install the rest, for example (replace with proper selector):
# python -m pip install "torch==2.x.x+cuXXX" -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps

# After installing packages, you can freeze exact versions with:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
